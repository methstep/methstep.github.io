She joined our group in March 2023 to understand the dynamics of heterochromatin, using C. elegans developmental oscillations as a model. Besides doing science, she bikes, hikes, and takes care of her plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFenna Poppelaars -Research associate\nFenna obtained her BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Utrecht University and a MSc in Biomolecular Sciences from VU Amsterdam. During her masters internships she acquired significant experience with microscopy techniques, employing smFISH and MS2-tagging to evaluate transcription in situ, and profiling of cell competition in organoids. She joined the Methot group in July 2025 to develop new microscopy tools to study transcription robustness and dynamics in C. elegans larvae. Outside the lab, she knits, hikes, and does triathlons."
