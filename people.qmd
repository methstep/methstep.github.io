### Leonie Fabbro Burtschell - PhD student

Leonie obtained a French-German BSc in Human and Molecular Biology from the Universities of Saarbr√ºcken and Strasbourg and a MSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from the University of Strasbourg. During her master thesis at the IGBMC in Strasbourg she focused on understanding the role of BCL7 proteins in SWI/SNF assembly and function. She joined the Methot group as a PhD student in March 2023, focusing on understanding the dynamics of heterochromatin during development, using *C. elegans* developmental oscillations as a model. Besides doing science, she bikes, hikes, and takes care of her plants.
