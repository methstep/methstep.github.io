### Leonie Fabbro Burtschell -<br>PhD student
Leonie obtained a French-German BSc in Human and Molecular Biology from the Universities of Saarbr√ºcken and Strasbourg and a MSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from the University of Strasbourg. During her master thesis she focused on understanding the role of BCL7 proteins in SWI/SNF assembly and function. She joined our group in March 2023 to understand the dynamics of heterochromatin, using *C. elegans* developmental oscillations as a model. Besides doing science, she bikes, hikes, and takes care of her plants.

### Fenna Poppelaars -<br>Research associate
Fenna obtained her BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Utrecht University and a MSc in Biomolecular Sciences from VU Amsterdam. During her masters internships she acquired significant experience with microscopy techniques, employing smFISH and MS2-tagging to evaluate transcription *in situ*, and profiling of cell competition in organoids. She joined the Methot group in July 2025 to develop new microscopy tools to study transcription robustness and dynamics in *C. elegans* larvae. Outside the lab, she knits, hikes, and does triathlons.
